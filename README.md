# Skin Cancer Classifier
The Skin Cancer Classifier is a Bio-Informatics project which relies on an ML model to classify skin cells containing cancer.

This model relies on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which takes skin cell photographs as inputs and classifies whether the patient under test is suffering from Skin Cancer.

## Files
load_data.py => This Files loads input data to test/detect Cancer
pretraining.py => This file sets up the neural network model, so that it can work as a classifier.
resize.py => This file will automatically resize and grayscale the input photographs so that they can be processed for the easier use of the model.

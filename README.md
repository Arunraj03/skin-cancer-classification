# Skin Cancer Classifier
The Skin Cancer Classifier is a Bio-Informatics project which relies on an ML model to classify skin cells containing cancer.

This model relies on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which takes skin cell photographs as inputs and classifies whether the patient under test is suffering from Skin Cancer.
